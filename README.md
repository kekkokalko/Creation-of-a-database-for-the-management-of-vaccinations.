#Database_Nazionale_Vaccinazioni_Covid19.
This is my project completed during the 2020/2021 academic year.
The subject that is treated is Databases.
In this project, a database for vaccination management was created. The entire vaccination cycle of a specific user is managed: from the booking for vaccination, through the anamnesis, up to the actual vaccination, whether it is one or two doses. The data of all the patients involved in this cycle, information on the type and quantity of vaccines present in the various registered hubs are kept.
Triggers and procedures have been implemented in PL / SQL.
